# Custom C Shell (Bash-like)

Welcome to our Custom C Shell project! This collaborative effort was undertaken with the goal of recreating a fully functional shell similar to the Bash shell. Our team worked diligently to implement essential features, including built-in commands such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`. In addition to these built-ins, we paid meticulous attention to memory management to ensure the absence of memory leaks.

And we added a color for prompt, for lunch Minishell with color:

`./minishell color`

The color supported are:  `gray`  `red`  `green`  `yellow`  `blue`  `purple` `cyan` `white`

## Features:

- **Bash-like Environment:** Our shell provides a familiar environment for users who are accustomed to working with the Bash shell.

- **Built-in Commands:** We've recreated several built-in commands commonly found in Unix-like shells, making it easy to perform everyday tasks within our shell.

- **Memory Leak Prevention:** We understand the importance of efficient memory management, and our code has been designed to minimize and eliminate memory leaks.
